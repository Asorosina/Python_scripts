##PORT SCANNER
This port scanner prompts the user to input one or more targets and a range of ports. 
The target could be either an IP address or a domain name.
The scanner then returns the ports that are open together with the grabbed banner, if available.

##KEYLOGGER
This keylogger records every keystroke made on the target host that has executed the program, saving them in a file named keylogfile.txt located in the same target host.
The file path is specific to Linux, so this programme works exclusively on a Linux target machine.
